CL-CLX is the standard X Window System client library for Common Lisp,
equivalent to the Xlib library for the C Programming Language.
CLX is written solely in Common Lisp; it does not use Xlib.

CLX contains data types, functions and macros to interact with an X
server by sending requests and receiving events and replies.
